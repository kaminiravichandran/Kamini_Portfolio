Hi! I am Kamini Ravichandran, a Masters student in Business Analytics at the University of Texas at Dallas with a prior bachelors in Engineering. 

I began my career with the idea of building something which would add value to people's lives. As a kid, I always enjoyed math and storytelling in english lit. I loved going into my own world of imagination and pen down stories which is a way to release some of my creative energy while also scrunching math problems in my leisure time. In my journey to dicover a way to combine my two passions I tripped over this whole new world of Data Science. Learning about data science through my rigorous coursework at UTD and training via several hands on projects with data I discovered my true calling: Data Analytics. Data Storytelling is an art that pulls at my creative strings to derive usable insights and meaning from chunks of data used in a variety of businesses. The data is a strong witness to the story I wish to convey and I am continuously amazed at my ability to narrate any story I choose including, problems in healthcare like breast cancer detection to producing better hotel marketing campaigns. I know now that this is where I belong amidst the science of all things data!

Outside of work I have learnt Carnatic Music for 12 years and upload my own song videos on my Instagram page 'kamikaze_vibes'. I recently started learning Mixed Martial arts and also love volunteering for the Infinity Lions Club to do my bit for a more positive society.
